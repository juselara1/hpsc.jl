# High Performance Machine Learning in Julia

In this book, we will explore the use of `julia` for high-performance machine learning. We will start with an introduction to the language and its unique features that make it ideal for high-performance computing. We will then move on to explore the various machine learning libraries available in Julia, including `Zygote`, `Flux.jl` and `Turing.jl`.
