# Parallel Computing
---

Parallel computing is a type of computation in which many calculations or processes are carried out simultaneously. Large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which can then be solved at the same time. In `Julia` we have have the following options for parallel computing: coroutines, threading, distributed and GPUs.
