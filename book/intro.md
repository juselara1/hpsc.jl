# High Performance Scientific Computing in Julia

In this book, we will explore the use of `Julia` for high-performance scientific computing. We will start with an introduction to the language and its unique features that make it ideal for high-performance computing. We will then move on to explore different topics like parallel computing, data management and visualization, linear algebra, differential equations, optimization, signal and image processing, machine learning, probabilistic programming, and quantum computing.
